Sheshory Chalet Landing Page

This project represents the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Sheshory Chalet
landing page, built using HTML, Sass, JavaScript, and Parcel. The landing page
not only provides a visually appealing introduction to Sheshory Chalet but also
integrates the Google Review API to display real-time customer reviews.
